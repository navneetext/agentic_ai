            "LLM_Answer": "Vector embeddings are numerical representations of objects or concepts in a multi-dimensional space. They are used in machine learning and natural language processing to represent words, phrases, or documents in a way that captures their semantic relationships. By converting words or entities into vectors, it becomes easier for algorithms to process and analyze them based on their contextual meanings and similarities.",
